                <h5> Match Format </h5> <br>

                <h5>Match Times & Courts</h5> <br>
Players are to play matches with all other players in their Group.  All matches are arranged by Players at a time and court location by mutual agreement. Most players would prefer to e-mail other players to advice of their availability and courts about one week in advance. Please be flexible and accommodating.  Matches not played do not benefit either player.
                <br><br>
RPTC Players -- RPTC has a process for members to follow when they wish to play UTR League matches so their opponents do not have to pay guest fee.
                <br><br>

                    <li>
                        Members must pay an $8 League Fee to RPTC in order to waive the guest fees for the season of play.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ol>
                        Most of the players in the league are in San Diego North County. If you are from other areas, you may have to play all away-matches. In the near future, we are planning for UTR League in La Jolla.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Coaching Allowed Between Sets</h5> <br>
Coaching is only allowed at end of each set, limited to 3 minutes.  Abuse of this rule, after one warning from your opponent, will result in penalty point. Please turn off your cell phone during the match. Use of cell phone is considered coaching. If player must use the cell phone for whatever reason, please ask permission from your opponent during changeovers.
                <br><br>
Spectators and parents are welcome to watch and support their players, but are not allowed to speak to the player. As a courtesy to your opponent, only English is to be used for cheers. Spectators are not allowed to interfere with the match. Don't try to be helpful or make any remarks on behalf of either player. If you find spectators are not following this rule, please let them know of this rule. After one warning, the Three-Strike Rule will apply.
                <br><br>
                <h5>New Tennis Balls</h5><br>
Each player shall bring a can of three new balls before the match. One new and unopened can of balls will be used for the match. The winner shall take the other unopened can of new balls and report the score. If the player responsible for new balls did not bring new balls as required, then that player will bring a new can of unopened ball to the winner at a time and place of his/her choosing. All players should always have a new can of balls in their bag.  Only yellow balls are allowed.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Line Calls</h5><br>
The rules of tennis says that you have to clearly see the ball out, to be able to call the ball out; otherwise, you must give your opponent the benefit of the doubt, and call the ball in. Players who are willing to reverse their initial calls in the cause of fair play, are appreciated by their opponents.  By the same token, players who call the lines real tight on crucial points are viewed in negative light. If the League Director gets complaints from many players about a particular player, that player may be barred from playing future league matches. Line call disputes are not subject to the Three-Strike Rule.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Three-Strike Rule</h5><br>
If you receive 3 penalty points in any one season (quarter), all your match wins will be recorded as default and not credited for UTR.  Match losses will be recorded to the benefit of your opponents.   You will not be able to play in the league for the remaining of current season as well as the following season.
                <br><br>
If you are late by 15 minutes, or postpone a match within 24-hours of confirmed match time, your opponent has the option to give you a penalty point.
                <br><br>
A penalty point can be given for defaults or unsportsmanlike conduct, which cannot be disputed.  Hitting a ball over the fence after the point is over, is an undisputed unsportsmanlike conduct.  In this case, the offending player shall be given a chance to correct his/her behavior with one warning.  If another undisputed unsportsmanlike conduct happens again, a penalty point can be given.  Only lateness and postponement of match within 24-hours do not require a warning, to receive a penalty point.
                <br><br>
Prior to making a request to record a penalty, please make sure you have already informed the other Player of your intent to penalize him/her.
                <br><br>
Disputes over line calls can be unsportsmanlike conduct, but because of the uncertainty of the dispute (who is right or wrong), a penalty point cannot be given by either player.  See the section on Line Calls.
                <br><br>
You can only receive one penalty point per match.  Abuse of this rule or giving reciprocal penalty point will not be viewed upon favorably.  In any dispute brought to the attention of League Director for arbitration, members agree to abide by League Director's sole decision without recourse.  Further escalation may result in termination of league membership.
                <br><br>
                <h5>75% Completion Rule</h5><br>
Players must complete at least 75% of all matches to play the next season. If a player could not play or finish a match within the allotted time, s/he may be subject to Forfeit (see below). This match counts against the forfeited player as an unplayed match for determining the 75% matches played. For the opponents of the forfeited player, the match will count as a match played. For injured players who cannot play after the season start, they will have to sit out the next season in order to be eligible to play again.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Forfeit Matches</h5><br>
In the final two weeks in the season, Players may request to forfeit their opponents if the following conditions are met.  If both Players tried, in good faith, to schedule their match, but were unable to do so before the end of the season, then forfeit will not be recorded against either Player.  Forfeits will be recorded starting in Season 3.
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
At least 3 consecutive attempts to schedule a match in good faith; the last attempt to be within two weeks of the end of season.
                    </li><li>
                        Offered to be flexible with schedule and location of match.
                </li><li>
Inform your opponent of your intention to request a forfeit.
                </li>
                </ol>

<h5>Withdraw from League</h5><br>
Prior to the final two weeks of the season, Players are allow to Withdraw from the league.  Withdraws mean you are withdrawing from all remaining matches in the season.  Any matches you have played will still be credited for UTR.  Withdrawing will prevent the other Players from forfeiting you in the final two weeks of the season.  Forfeits are recorded in Player's permanent record.  The downside is that you would not be able to play next season.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Pro Set for Lowest Group</h5><br>
For younger players in the lowest group, Pro Set match in lieu of two out of three sets is the standard format and encouraged. Pro Set is won by first player to 8 games win by two games. 7-point tiebreaker at 7-7. If press for time for the higher groups, this match format can be used.  Only yellow balls are allowed.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Bonus Matches</h5><br>
After Players have completed 75% their matches in their group before the end of the season, they have the option to request matches with other Players in the adjacent groups.  For example, Player in Group 2 completes 75% matches, s/he has the option to request matches from Players in Groups 1 and 3.  At least one of the players must complete 75% matches for bonus matches to count towards UTR.  It is recommended that bonus matches be with other Players who have also completed 75% matches in their respective groups.  Request for Bonus Matches are based on mutual agreement of the Players.
                <br><br>
                <h5>End of Season</h5><br>
At the end of the season, all league matches played will be uploaded into the UTR database for calculation of player's UTR. Once up-loaded, your results will be available in one week, and will be posted on this website. Your UTR will include league matches played, as well as any tournaments or UTR sanctioned matches played during the season. Your new UTR will determine your group for the next season.
